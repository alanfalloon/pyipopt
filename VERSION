Version log

	Version 0.1 List works

	Version 0.2 All Numpy types */
	Version 0.3 Change the module interface to allocate more nlp instances instead of one
	now use nlp = pyipopt.create(xxx)
		and nlp.solve
			nlp.close()

	you can create multiple instance of nlp. [Tested]

	Version 0.4
	
	To allocate more models in a hooker. Planning to move all the pointers to the 
	PyObject (callback function in Python) to the user_data field
